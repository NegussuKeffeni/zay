                                    The Zay, who inhabit the islands of Ethiopia’s Lake Zway, as well as lakeside towns
                                    and villages, claim to have first settled in the area in the 9th century, when, religious refugees
                                    were fleeing queen Yodit who was destroying churches and church property in Aksum. Other
                                    migratory waves to the islands and Lake Zway area are said to have occurred during the reign
                                    of Amda Tsion (r. 1314-1344), Zara Yaqob (r. 1434-1468) and finally during the wars with
                                    Imam Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi around 1527. References to the islands are found in
                                    various Royal Chronicles and travelers’ accounts such as: a chronicle collected by a priest
                                    Qésä Gäbez Täklä Haymanot of Aksum (Andersen 2000; Sergew Hable Selassie 1972); the
                                    chronicle of Susneyos (Esteves Pereira 1892); the Futuh al-Habash, a chronicle of the Muslim
                                    conquest of Abyssinia (Shihāb 2003); Bahrey’s History of the Galla (Bahrey 1954); the
                                    Chronicle of Menilek II (Gabra Sêllāse 1930b); stories recorded by Father Francisco Alvares
                                    (1961) who traveled there in 1520; W.C. Harris (1844b, 1844a), a British emissary to Ethiopia
                                    during the time of Sahle Selassie; a traveler, Captain M.S. Wellby (1901); (Blundell 1906)
                                    (Hodson 1922) (Le Roux 1905) and even studies such as those by: Eike Haberland (1963),
                                    Paul B. Henze (1973a, 1973b, 1989), Ronny Meyer (2000, 2005) Finally, linguistic surveys of
                                    the Zay language (Zay or Zayña) have also been carried out, and can provide information as
                                    to how many Zay speakers there are, though the data seems to be incomplete (cf. Gardner
                                    and Siebert 2001; Jordan et al. 2011; Wedekind and Wedekind 2002).
                                    <br>
                                    The Zay are a Semitic-speaking people whose language is quite similar to Silt’e,
                                    Ulbarag and Wolane dialects of the Gurage group, as well as the Harari language (Haberland
                                    1963:787). Ancestors of the Zay most likely moved on a large scale to the islands during the
                                    Oromo migrations during the 16th and 17th centuries (Henze 1973:31). The first inhabitants of
                                    the islands were most likely from different groups, as some Zay have claimed that they were
                                    religious refugees from the northern city of Axum or the eastern city of Harar during a time
                                    when these cities were sacked by Muslim conquest. The islands are mentioned in various
                                    royal chronicles and travelers’ accounts as well. A prophet, Abba Mikael, head monk at Dabra
                                    Malago (in Simean), was banished to the islands by emperor Baeda Maryam (r. 1468-1478)
                                    for predicting the defeat of the Amhara army at the hands of the Muslims (Perruchon 1893).
                                    Lake Zway is also mentioned during the time of the wars with Ahmed Grañ (a 16th century
                                    Muslim ruler from Harar who is said to have destroyed many churches and church property),
                                    under the rule of Lebna Dengel (r. 1508-1540) and Galawdewos (r. 1540-1559). An account is
                                    given of a Muslim general who camped on the shores on the lake and wanted to sack the
                                    churches there. However, his men were frightened at the thought of crossing by boat so the
                                    general had to give up on this idea (Shihāb 2003:306). Again, the lake and the islands are
                                    mentioned during the reign of emperor Sartza Dengel (r. 1563-1595) during which an Oromo
                                    army that was causing trouble in Shoa was defeated in the area (Beckingham and
                                    Huntingford 1954b:lxxv).
                                    <br>
                                    By isolating themselves on the islands, the Zay are said to have been able to preserve
                                    their Orthodox Christian faith and develop a unique culture, despite being surrounded by the
                                    predominantly Muslim and pagan Oromo. It wasn’t until 1886, when Emperor Menelik II
                                    ‘reconquered’ the Zay region, that they were reconnected with Christian Ethiopia (Henze
                                    1989:34-35). Prior to that time, contact with the northern Ethiopian Empire was very limited
                                    and typically involved monks or priests visiting the islands for short periods. After
                                    recognizing the authority of Menelik II, the Zay were granted the status of an independent
                                    tribal entity, governed by a Balambaras2(title granted to local governors).
                                    Due to therelatively amicable relations between the Zay and the surrounding Oromo, currently many
                                    Zay have settled on the lakeshores and began farming large tracts of land and keeping herds
                                    of cattle. Many of the Zay who settled on the lakeshores have assimilated to Oromo culture
                                    and intermarriage is not uncommon (Haberland 1963:788). More recently, an increasing
                                    number of Zay have been moving to the mainland towns because living on the islands
                                    presents economic and educational limitations.
                                    <br>
                                    With the implementation of ethnic-federalism in 1991, Ethiopian citizens were no
                                    longer only members of their respective states, but also members of a specific ethnic group.
                                    An example of this is that for election registration purposes, Ethiopians must state their
                                    ethnic identity (Abbink 1997:160). A key aspect of ethnic-federalism that pertains to the Zay
                                    is the status of “minority groups.” As the number of Zay is estimated between twenty and
                                    thirty thousand, it is imperative to see how a system that is supposed to support and promote
                                    ethnicity is actually doing – or failing to do – so. With these issues in mind the importance of
                                    “ethnic identity” labels comes to the forefront. If other groups in Ethiopia have been granted
                                    this special status it begs the question: why have the Zay not been given this special status as
                                    well?

                The history and oral traditions of the Zay are often interrelated with much large0r
                events in Ethiopia. They are part of the history of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the
                Ethiopian State, as well as the Aksumite and Gurage peoples’ history. As we will see,
                relationships between Zay history and the history of greater Ethiopia range from Muslim
                invasions to the conquests of Menilek II and from the destruction of churches in Aksum to
                emperors and Christians seeking refuge on the islands of Lake Zway. References to Lake Zway
                and a Christian population living there can be found in various Royal Chronicles, travelers’
                tales, journals, and oral traditions. These sources help us shed light on the mismatched and
                sometimes contradictory historical traditions that have been passed down for generations.
                The historical record has not been kind to the researcher here, as many sources do not recall
                the people living on the islands, but deal primarily with external history and events related to
                the islands, such as wars, conquests, and occupations. However, we do have various oral
                traditions correlating with the historical events and sources. This is not to say that the oral
                traditions are historical truths, and we should not analyze them as such. Rather, we must
                critically assess oral traditions through a modern lens focusing on the connections and
                relationships that these oral traditions seek to explain and highlight. With these
                understandings in mind, we can then turn to history and see how it has shaped current
                events, understandings, and relationships. This chapter aims to bring together all the written
                sources and corresponding oral traditions on Lake Zway and the Zay in an attempt to
                reconstruct the historical timeline. The timeline may occasionally jump a few hundred years,
                and some of the sources are based on legends and exaggerated chronicles; however, it will
                nonetheless help to uncover the connections and relationships associated with Zay historical
                traditions and lay a foundation from which the Zay identities – discussed in the next chapter
                – are built upon. Oral traditions are, occasionally, presented at length here; the intentions are
                to give a greater voice to these Zay oral traditions without filter and to lend credence to the
                subsequent analysis. The chapter is presented as follows: first, a discussion on the etymology
                of “Zay.” Second, an overview of Lake Zway and its islands is given. Third, Zay origins are
                discussed followed by, fourth, the four waves of migration to Lake Zway.
